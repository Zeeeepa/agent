# Agent

A high-velocity, self-sufficient Python AI agent framework that leverages the OpenAI Python SDK to interpret natural-language commands, generate and execute code dynamically, and manage its runtime environment with zero friction. It features automated dependency installation, secure environment configuration, structured logging, and a minimalist plugin interface for embedding powerful Python tools—all under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.
